I'm Lindsay Black, and I'll be guiding you through British Life and Culture this term. Some of you might be wondering what to expect—whether we'll focus on teaching techniques or textbook analysis—but today, let's go over the practical details first.</p><p>Our classroom is Room 13 on the first floor, with sessions every Monday and Wednesday from 4:30 to 6:00 pm. I'll be available in Office 7B on Fridays at 6:00 pm if you need any assistance—though this is for course-related help rather than professional development discussions.</p><p>You'll need to get the British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book—please make sure to purchase the correct edition, as we won't be using the teacher's version or any copied materials.</p><p>I'm really looking forward to our time together exploring British culture. I'll see you all on Monday in Room 13!</p>","audio":"content.mp3","st_pic":"","xtlist":[{"xt_xh":"1","xt_nr":"ets_th1 What does the speaker expect from students?","xt_wj":"","xt_wj2":"","xt_value":"","xt_analy":"","xt_pic":"","answer":"C","xxlist":[{"xx_xh":"1","xx_mc":"A","xx_nr":" Focus on textbook analysis.","xx_wj":""},{"xx_xh":"2","xx_mc":"B","xx_nr":" Use various copied materials.","xx_wj":""},{"xx_xh":"3","xx_mc":"C","xx_nr":" Reach the teacher for assistance if needed.","xx_wj":""}]},{"xt_xh":"2","xt_nr":"ets_th2 What is the speaker mainly talking about?","xt_wj":"","xt_wj2":"","xt_value":"","xt_analy":"","xt_pic":"","answer":"C","xxlist":[{"xx_xh":"1","xx_mc":"A","xx_nr":" Teaching techniques.","xx_wj":""},{"xx_xh":"2","xx_mc":"B","xx_nr":" Professional development.","xx_wj":""},{"xx_xh":"3","xx_mc":"C","xx_nr":" Course details.","xx_wj":""}]}]}}
