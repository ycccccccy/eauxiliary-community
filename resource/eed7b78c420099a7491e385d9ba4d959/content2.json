Or is it too hard?</p><p>M: Honestly, it's just too time-consuming. I already have a lot of research to do for another subject.</p><p>W: That's fine. Would you rather work on the presentation?</p><p>M: Yes, I'd love that! I enjoy making slides.</p><p>W: Perfect. I'll take care of the research then, and we can ask Sarah to handle the data collection.</p><p>M: Great idea. She's really good with data!</p>","audio":"content.mp3","st_pic":"","xtlist":[{"xt_xh":"1","xt_nr":"7.
